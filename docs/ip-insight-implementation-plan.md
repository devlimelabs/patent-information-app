## SEO Strategy

### Core SEO Principles

#### 1. Technical SEO Foundation
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Implement Angular Universal to ensure all pages are fully rendered on the server before being sent to the client, improving crawlability and initial load performance.
- **Semantic HTML Structure**: Use proper HTML5 semantic elements throughout the application to clearly communicate content structure to search engines.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure responsive design and mobile-friendly experience as mobile-first indexing is now standard.
- **Core Web Vitals Optimization**: Focus on Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) metrics to improve search ranking.
- **Site Speed Optimization**: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, and caching strategies to maximize performance.

#### 2. Content SEO Strategy
- **Keyword Research & Implementation**: Conduct comprehensive keyword research for patent-related terms and implement strategically throughout the application.
- **Unique Metadata**: Generate unique, descriptive titles and meta descriptions for all pages, including dynamically generated patent detail pages.
- **Content Hierarchy**: Implement clear H1-H6 heading structure to communicate content importance and relationships.
- **Rich Content**: Develop informative, valuable content around patent topics, search strategies, and intellectual property concepts.
- **Featured Snippet Optimization**: Structure content to target featured snippet opportunities for patent-related queries.

#### 3. Structured Data Implementation
- **Schema.org Markup**: Implement comprehensive structured data using JSON-LD format:
  - Patent information (custom schema)
  - BreadcrumbList for navigation paths
  - SearchAction for internal search functionality
  - Organization for company information
  - WebPage for general page information
  - Article for blog/informational content
- **Rich Results Testing**: Regularly validate structured data implementation using Google's Rich Results Test tool.

#### 4. Crawlability & Indexation
- **XML Sitemap**: Implement automated sitemap generation with:
  - Change frequency and priority attributes
  - Last modification dates
  - Segmentation for large sites
  - Automatic submission to search engines
- **Robots.txt**: Configure properly to guide crawler behavior and prevent crawling of non-valuable pages.
- **Canonical URLs**: Implement canonical tags to prevent duplicate content issues, especially for filtered search results.
- **Pagination SEO**: Implement proper rel="next" and rel="prev" for paginated content.

#### 5. User Experience & Engagement
- **Search Intent Alignment**: Ensure page content aligns with user search intent for patent-related queries.
- **Dwell Time Optimization**: Create engaging, valuable content that keeps users on the page.
