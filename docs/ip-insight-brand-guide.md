# IP Insight: Brand & Style Guide

## Brand Concept Evolution

After careful consideration of the project's goals to simplify patent information and make it accessible, we're proposing a brand evolution from "IP Insight" to **"Edison"** - a name that embodies innovation, trustworthiness, and the democratization of intellectual property.

### Brand Name Rationale

**Edison** was chosen for several compelling reasons:

1. **Historical Significance**: Thomas Edison holds 1,093 US patents, symbolizing prolific innovation and the practical application of ideas.

2. **Name Recognition**: Edison is universally recognized and associated with invention, creativity, and technological progress.

3. **Simplicity**: The name is short, memorable, and easy to pronounce across languages.

4. **Metaphorical Meaning**: Just as Edison brought light to the world with the practical electric light bulb, our platform brings clarity to the often obscure world of patents.

5. **Domain Availability**: Edison.io and GetEdison.com are viable domain options for the platform.

### Tagline Options

- **"Illuminating Innovation"** - Connects to Edison's most famous invention while conveying our mission to bring clarity to patents
