# Data Integration Foundation

This directory contains the implementation of the data integration foundation for the Edison patent information application. The implementation focuses on the PatentsView API integration as the primary source for US patent data.

## Architecture

The data integration foundation is organized into the following components:

### 1. API Clients

- `PatentsViewApiClient`: Handles communication with the PatentsView API, including authentication, request formatting, and error handling.

### 2. Data Models

- `Patent`: The unified patent data model that normalizes data from different sources into a consistent format.
- Supporting interfaces for patent components (claims, inventors, assignees, etc.)

### 3. Transformers

- `PatentsViewTransformerService`: Converts raw PatentsView API responses into the unified patent model.

### 4. Validators

- `PatentValidatorService`: Ensures data quality and consistency by validating patent data against business rules.

### 5. Loaders

- `FirestorePatentLoaderService`: Handles loading validated patent data into Firestore, including batch operations and version control.

### 6. Services

- `DataIntegrationService`: Orchestrates the entire data integration process, from fetching data to storing it in Firestore.

## Usage

The data integration foundation can be used through the `DataIntegrationService`, which provides methods for integrating patent data:

```typescript
// Fetch and integrate a single patent by ID
dataIntegrationService.integratePatentById('US10000000');

// Fetch and integrate patents from a date range
dataIntegrationService.integratePatentsByDateRange('2023-01-01', '2023-01-31');

// Fetch and integrate patents using a custom query
dataIntegrationService.integratePatentsViewData({
  _gte: { patent_date: '2023-01-01' },
  _contains: { patent_title: 'artificial intelligence' }
});
```

## Testing

A test component is available at `/test` route to demonstrate the data integration functionality:

- Fetch a sample patent by ID
- Fetch recent patents from the last 30 days

## Data Flow

1. **Extraction**: Data is fetched from the PatentsView API using the `PatentsViewApiClient`.
2. **Transformation**: Raw API responses are transformed into the unified patent model using the `PatentsViewTransformerService`.
3. **Validation**: Transformed data is validated using the `PatentValidatorService` to ensure quality and consistency.
4. **Loading**: Validated data is loaded into Firestore using the `FirestorePatentLoaderService`.

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement incremental update processes for efficient synchronization
2. Add support for EPO OPS API integration
3. Develop cross-source deduplication mechanisms
4. Implement advanced search indexing with Meilisearch
